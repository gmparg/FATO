If present, the time value SHALL be less (earlier) than or equal to the eventTime value.  It SHALL also contain a time zone offset value.  The coordination and integrity of distributed computing requires time synchronisation of EPCIS events conveying sensor data. Therefore, when populating the time, startTime, and endTime field, EPCIS capture applications SHOULD apply established time synchronisation protocols such as IEEE 1588-2008, which provides a standard method to synchronise device clocks in a network.  Note: The eventTime applies to the completion of a business step, not a sensor observation. For instance, for a receiving event accommodating a sensor element, the eventTime indicates when goods were received &apos; it gives no information when certain conditions (e.g. a specific temperature value) held true. In some circumstances, event and sensor observation times may correspond though (e.g. if a quality inspector checks certain properties of goods). In such cases, indicating the eventTime may be sufficient.</rdfs:comment>

        <obo:IAO_0000115 xml:lang="en">Health claim means any claim made on the label or in labeling of a food, including a dietary supplement, that expressly or by implication, including &quot;third party&quot; references, written statements (e.g., a brand name including a term such as &quot;heart&quot;), symbols (e.g., a heart symbol), or vignettes, characterizes the relationship of any substance to a disease or health-related condition. See also 21 CFR 101.14  [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.14].

A claim is a health claim if in the naming of the substance or category of substances, there is a description or indication of a functionality or an implied effect on health; examples: &quot;contains antioxidants&quot; (the function is an antioxidant effect); &quot;containsprobiotics/prebiotics&quot; (the reference to probiotic/prebiotic implies a health benefit). Equally, claims which refer to an indication of a functionality in the description of a nutrient or a substance (for instance as an adjective to the substance) should also beclassified as a health claim; examples: &quot;with prebiotic fibres&quot; or &quot;contains prebiotic fibres&quot;.

In Europe, a health claim is any statement about a relationship between food and health [http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/claims/health_claims_en.htm], and only authorized health claims are legal [see http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/claims/community_register/health_claims_en.htm].

A traditional food product is a product frequently consumed or associated to specific celebrations and/or seasons, normally transmitted from one generation to another, made with care in a specific way according to the gastronomic heritage, with little or no processing/manipulation, that is distinguished and known because of its sensory properties and associated to a certain local area, region or country.

&quot;Ethnic food&quot; has been used colloquially for a wide variety of foodstuffs, virtually any that can be identified in the public mind with a foreign source or an ethnic minority group. In the narrower ethnographic meaning, it pertains only to food prepared or consumed by members of an ethnic group as a manifestation of its ethnicity. In the end ethnic food is food that members of an ethnic group consider their own and that others attribute to them. [http://www.answers.com/topic/ethnic-cuisines]</obo:IAO_0000115>

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) and Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) are geographical indications, or more precisely regimes, within the framework. The law (enforced within the EU and being gradually expanded internationally via bilateral agreements of the EU with non-EU countries) ensures that only products genuinely originating in that region are allowed in commerce as such. The legislation came into force in 1992. The purpose of the law is to protect the reputation of the regional foods and eliminate the unfair competition and misleading of consumers by non-genuine products, which may be of inferior quality or of different flavour.

An event containing an ErrorDeclaration element SHALL be otherwise identical to a prior event, &apos;otherwise identical&apos; meaning that all fields of the event other than the ErrorDeclaration element and the value of recordTime are exactly equal to the prior event. (Note that includes the eventID field: the eventID of the error declaration will be equal to the eventID of the prior event or null if the eventID of the prior event is null. This is the sole case where the same non-null eventID may appear in two events.) The semantics of an event containing the ErrorDeclaration element are that all assertions implied by the prior event are considered to be erroneous, as of the specified declarationTime. The prior event is not modified in any way, and subsequent queries will return both the prior event and the error declaration.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdf:Description rdf:about="https://ref.gs1.org/epcis/AggregationEvent">
        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The event type AggregationEvent describes events that apply to objects that have been aggregated to one another. In such an event, there is a set of &apos;contained&apos; objects that have been aggregated within a &apos;containing&apos; entity that&apos;s meant to identify the aggregation itself.  This event type is intended to be used for &apos;aggregations&apos;, meaning an association where there is a strong physical relationship between the containing and the contained objects such that they will all occupy the same location at the same time, until such time as they are disaggregated.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdf:Description rdf:about="https://ref.gs1.org/epcis/AssociationEvent">
        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The event type AssociationEvent describes the association or disassociation of one or several physical objects with a parent object or a specific physical location.  Like the AggregationEvent, the AssociationEvent is also used to capture associations where there is a strong physical relationship between the containing and the contained objects such that they will all occupy the same location at the same time, until such time as they are disaggregated. However, the AggregationEvent does not allow for associations of objects with physical locations;  if action is DELETE while omitting the childEPC and childQuantityList field, all contained children are disaggregated from the containing parent. Because there are situations in which associations are more permanent, i.e. beyond the physical flow of goods (e.g. packing/unpacking and loading/unloading), an AssociationEvent SHOULD be used: (a) when objects need to be associated with a physical location or (b) when the parent object could also be subject to other, more temporary associations (i.e. captured using AggregationEvent).</rdfs:comment>

The components of a vector in a coordinate system can be specified by setting the value of component to indicate which vector component has magnitude indicated by the value parameter.  The SensorReport element is then repeated as two or three instances to express each component of the vector in two or three dimensions, the pair or trio of SensorReport elements sharing the same values for all fields except value, component and uom (which may differ for each vector component).
