See also 21 CFR 101.14  [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.14].\n\nA claim is a health claim if in the naming of the substance or category of substances, there is a description or indication of a functionality or an implied effect on health; examples: \"contains antioxidants\" (the function is an antioxidant effect); \"containsprobiotics/prebiotics\" (the reference to probiotic/prebiotic implies a health benefit). Equally, claims which refer to an indication of a functionality in the description of a nutrient or a substance (for instance as an adjective to the substance) should also beclassified as a health claim; examples: \"with prebiotic fibres\" or \"contains prebiotic fibres\".\n\nIn Europe, a health claim is any statement about a relationship between food and health [http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/claims/health_claims_en.htm], and only authorized health claims are legal [see http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/claims/community_register/health_claims_en.htm].\nCOMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 432/2012 of 16 May 2012 establishes a list of permitted health claims made on foods, other than those referring to the reduction of disease risk and to children\"s development and health [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:136:0001:0040:en:PDF]"

Like the AggregationEvent, the AssociationEvent is also used to capture associations where there is a strong physical relationship between the containing and the contained objects such that they will all occupy the same location at the same time, until such time as they are disaggregated. However, the AggregationEvent does not allow for associations of objects with physical locations;  if action is DELETE while omitting the childEPC and childQuantityList field, all contained children are disaggregated from the containing parent. Because there are situations in which associations are more permanent, i.e. beyond the physical flow of goods (e.g. packing/unpacking and loading/unloading), an AssociationEvent SHOULD be used: (a) when objects need to be associated with a physical location or (b) when the parent object could also be subject to other, more temporary associations (i.e. captured using AggregationEvent)."

Therefore, when populating the time, startTime, and endTime field, EPCIS capture applications SHOULD apply established time synchronisation protocols such as IEEE 1588-2008, which provides a standard method to synchronise device clocks in a network.  Note: The eventTime applies to the completion of a business step, not a sensor observation. For instance, for a receiving event accommodating a sensor element, the eventTime indicates when goods were received ' it gives no information when certain conditions (e.g. a specific temperature value) held true. In some circumstances, event and sensor observation times may correspond though (e.g. if a quality inspector checks certain properties of goods). In such cases, indicating the eventTime may be sufficient."
